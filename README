PAPER PLOTS
===========
This tarball contains all of the ROOT macros and files required to generate the plots for the paper.

Additional Packages
===================
root -l (all of the required classes will be loaded by rootlogon.C)

Plotting Macros
===============
- Solid Angle Coverage
.x coverage.cc+

- Limit
.x limit.cc+

- Correlation Coefficient and Time Gap Fraction
.x compare_data_and_mc.cc+

- Beta/Correlation Coefficient Scatter
.x scatter.cc+

General Notes
=============
- The Canvas_Manager is declared as a global variable so that I can save them from the command line:
cans.save_all("blah")

[I know it's a hack, but I have not been able to work out a more elegant solution.]

- Because of this hack, it's not possible to run the macros in one Root session.  I usually quit a session before making another set of canvases.

- The plots involving data take some time because the total slow monopole sample is quite large.
